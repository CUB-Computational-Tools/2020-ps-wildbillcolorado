    "## What is a VECTOR?\n",
    "Super simple - it is a quantitiy that has a **value, as well as direction**. So instead of saying the velocity is 10 m/s, you HAVE to say **velocity is 10 m/s in a *blank* direction**. The quantitiy cannot exist without the direction. It's different than mass for instance, which is a SCALAR. Scalar's are quantities with a value and no direction, Vectors are quantities with a value and direction.  Some examples of a scalar include the number of apples a store sells, or the number of grains of sand on a beach. Some examples of vectors are wind measurements, and gravitational force (because it always points in the direction of the center of mass). \n",
