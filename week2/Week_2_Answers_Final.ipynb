The quantitiy cant exist without the direction. It's different that mass for instance, which is a SCALAR. Scalar's are quantities with a value and no direction, Vectors are quantities with a value and direction.  Some examples of a scalar include the number of apples a store sells, or the number of grains of sand on a beach. Some examples of vectors are wind, and gravitational force (because it always points in the direction of the center of mass). \n",
