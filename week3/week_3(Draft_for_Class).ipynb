In sedimentary rocks, we have clasitc and non-clastic sub classes, which further subdivide into other sub-sub-classes.

    "## These are pretty useful, because they allow us to plot 3 variables (or dimensions) in a 2 dimensional space. The only thing we need to make sure when plotting these, is the variables need to add to a constant. In most applications for undergrad geology courses, the variables are going to be 3 variables of a rock (like grain size, or chemical composition), and they are going to add to 100.\n",

    "## Using the above ternary, let's try to figure out how to classify a rock that is 65% sand, 32% gravel, and 3 % mud. This is probably going to be a bit confusing at first, and it's okay if it seems weird the first time through. Try to get to the end of the section, and hopefully everything will start to click towards the end. If we look at the above figure, notice, the top point represents 100% gravel, and the bottom line represents 0 % gravel. The right bottom point represents 100% mud, and the left side represents 0% mud. The bottom left corner represents 100% sand, and the right side represents 0 percent sand. Let's start with gravel. We would start at the very bottom line (this represents 0% gravel, and go straight up the triangle, until we reach 32% the height of the triangle, and we draw a straight line parellel with the bottom (the blue line). Next, lets do the mud axis, and so we know it's 3% mud. So we go to very left side, because that represents 0% mud, and we go straight to the bottom right corner, 3% of the distance to the corner and draw a line that is parallel to the left side. (this is the green line). \n",
    "## The point where these two lines intersect is the composition of the rock. Notice, if we draw a line that is perpendicular to the right side (red line), the point is intersected, and the sand value is given at about 65% on the bottom axis. \n",

In the example above,  the sand, gravel, and mud percentagess added up to 100. What if instead, the sample we were looking at was 15% gravel, 20% sand, 30% mud, and 35% crystalline? And we still wanted to plot on the mud/sand/gravel ternary diagram? It wouldnt work until we normalize the data. What we need to do is to only look at the gravel, sand, and mud paramteres and get rid of the crystalline.\n",
    "## So how do we normalize data? What we would do is say, gravel, sand, and mud make up 100% of what we want to look at, so 65%(15+20+30) of the rock is what we want to look at. 15/65 = 23%, 20/65 = 31%, and 30/65 =  46%. Now look, 23 + 31 + 46 adds up to 100. The data is now normallized. The normalization equation is as follows:\n",

In this next ternary, we're only going to be looking at feldspar content, quartz content, and lithic content in the main body of the ternary but we're going to add one more dimension - percent matrix. It ends up giving the ternary an elongate-triangle shape.\n",
